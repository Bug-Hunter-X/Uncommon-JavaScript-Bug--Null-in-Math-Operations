# Uncommon JavaScript Bug: Null in Math Operations

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to handling `null` values in mathematical operations.  While the code correctly handles null inputs, the behavior might be unexpected for developers unfamiliar with JavaScript's loose typing and null handling. The solution enhances readability and clarity.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the implicit behavior when a `null` value is encountered in mathematical operations. In Javascript, adding a null value to a number results in a null value rather than a TypeError or NaN. This behavior may not be intuitive to developers from other languages with stronger typing.

## Solution

The solution provides a more explicit way of handling `null` values, improving code readability and maintainability.
